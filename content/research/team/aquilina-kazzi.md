bio: "Ms Aquilina Kazzi is currently undertaking her PhD research in the biology of endogenous retroviruses at the University of Wollongong. Aquilina has completed a Bachelor of Biomedical science from the University of Western Sydney and went on to complete a Master of Medical Biotechnology at the University of Wollongong.  During her Master degree she joined the NERVLAB team led by Dr Dezerae Cox, where undertook a SKIP902 project establishing an ALFA-tagged expression model of HERV-K polyproteins. During this research project she developed skills in culturing immortalised mammalian cells, molecular cloning and protein purification. Aquilina is now working towards her PhD, undertaking a research project that aims to characterise the cellular footprint of human endogenous retroviruses. "
