bio: " Dylan Norris is currently a fourth-year undergraduate student undertaking his Honours research. Dylan is leading the development of a novel single-molecule assay for characterising protein aggregates of SOD1 derived from experimental model systems such as cells and mice. This assay will eventually allow us to profile aggregates from human samples, including from individuals living with motor neuron disease, to better understand their disease presentation, progression, and potentially prognosis."
