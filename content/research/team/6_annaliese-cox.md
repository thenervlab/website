name: "Annaliese Cox"

category: "Post-graduate Intern"

bio: "Annaliese Cox is interning at Molecular Horizons, University of Wollongong, where she's engaged in NERVLAB's groundbreaking research on endogenous retroviruses and their impact on human neurobiology. Annaliese completed her Bachelor of Laws/Bachelor of Science (Cell and Molecular Biology) in 2023 with Distinction. Annaliese's academic success has been recognised by her position on the Golden Key International Honours Society for being amongst the top 15% of students globally. Her project involves developing novel cell models to decouple the transcription and translation of endogenous retrovirus proteins and their mRNA. Motivated by a genuine curiosity for science and a desire to inspire future generations, Annaliese's internship journey is driven by her passion for bridging the gap between research and education. Annaliese is currently completing a Master of Teaching (Secondary Science) and hopes this experience will enrich her own personal lab experience, and also the experience of her future students in STEM."
