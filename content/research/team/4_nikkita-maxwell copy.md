bio: "Nikkita is a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Medical and Health Science, currently undertaking an honours project focused on the climate resilience of Fijian Lasioglossum bees. Her research employs proteomic approaches to identify key drivers of heat tolerance in these important pollinators.  She's working on annotating proteins relevant to thermotolerance from the genome of these bees and characterising the molecular mechanisms of thermal stability across specialist species found at different elevations.  Her findings will bridge the gap between physiological heat resilience and the thermal stability of the bee proteome, contributing to a deeper understanding of how these species adapt to climate change."
