NERVLAB are dedicated to unraveling the complexities of neurodegenerative diseases through innovative and inquisitive research. 

With a focus on Motor Neuron Disease (MND), we are developing novel tools, cutting-edge technologies, and custom data science solutions tailored for big biological data. Our multidisciplinary approach allows us to explore the intricate mechanisms underlying disease, with a particular emphasis on understanding protein aggregation, the role of Human Endogenous RetroViruses (HERVs), and how the complex interaction of these phenomenon contribute to the broader landscape of neurodegeneration. Through our efforts, we hope to pave the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat these devastating disorders.

## Neurodegenerative Disease

Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of nerve cells, leading to cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and ultimately, loss of independence. Clinical signs and symptoms vary depending on the specific disease but commonly include muscle weakness, tremors, impaired coordination, and cognitive impairment. These diseases can be sporadic, occurring without a clear family history, or familial, inherited through genetic mutations. Major genes associated with familial cases include those encoding proteins like amyloid precursor protein (APP), tau, FUS, TDP-43, SOD1, and alpha-synuclein. Despite significant advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders, there is currently no cure. While disease-modifying treatments are emerging, such as gene therapy and targeted drug interventions, they are yet to be widely available for the majority of cases. The complexity of pathology, coupled with challenges in developing effective therapies that can reach and protect neurons, underscores the urgent need for continued research and innovative approaches in the quest for treatments and ultimately a cure.

## Motor Neuron Disease (MND)

Motor Neuron Disease (MND), also known as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. These neurons are responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement, including walking, speaking, swallowing, and breathing. As MND progresses, individuals experience a gradual loss of muscle control, leading to muscle weakness, stiffness, and ultimately paralysis. Other symptoms may include muscle twitching, difficulty with speech and swallowing, and respiratory impairment.

Sporadic MND accounts for the majority (~90%) of cases, while familial MND is associated with mutations in genes including C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP, and FUS. However, as with the spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, the exact molecular cause of both sporadic and familial MND remains largely unknown. One of the unifying molecular characteristics is the accumulation of protein aggregates.

## Protein Aggregation

Proteins are essential molecules that perform a wide range of functions in the body, including providing structural support, facilitating chemical reactions, and transmitting signals within cells. Proper folding of proteins is crucial for their normal function. However, under certain conditions, proteins can misfold and aggregate, forming clumps or aggregates that are characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Motor Neuron Disease (MND).

Protein aggregation occurs when misfolded proteins fail to adopt their native structure and instead assemble into insoluble aggregates. These aggregates can accumulate within neurons, disrupting normal cellular processes and leading to neuronal dysfunction and ultimately cell death. The precise mechanisms underlying protein misfolding and aggregation are complex and multifaceted, involving various factors such as genetic mutations, environmental stressors, and impaired protein clearance pathways.

In neurodegenerative diseases like MND, protein aggregation is believed to play a significant role in disease pathogenesis. For example, in familial forms of MND, mutations in genes encoding proteins such as SOD1 and C9orf72 are known to promote protein misfolding and aggregation. The accumulation of these aberrant protein aggregates is thought to contribute to the selective degeneration of motor neurons observed in MND.

While the exact relationship between protein aggregation and neuronal toxicity is still being explored, evidence suggests that aggregated proteins can disrupt cellular processes, induce oxidative stress, and activate inflammatory responses, all of which contribute to neurodegeneration. Understanding the mechanisms underlying protein aggregation in MND is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing or reversing the toxic effects of protein aggregates on motor neurons.

## Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs):

Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that have become integrated into the human genome over millions of years of evolution. Although most HERVs have lost their ability to replicate, they still retain sequences resembling those of active retroviruses. HERVs have been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, serving as regulators of gene expression, promoters of genetic diversity, and potential triggers of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases like Motor Neuron Disease (MND), HERVs have garnered significant interest due to their potential involvement in disease pathogenesis. Studies have shown that HERV expression levels are altered in MND patients, with evidence suggesting increased expression of specific HERV families in affected brain regions. This overexpression of HERVs may contribute to neuroinflammation, neuronal dysfunction, protein aggregation and ultimately, motor neuron degeneration.

Emerging evidence also indicates that HERVs could serve as therapeutic targets for MND. Clinical trials exploring the efficacy of antiretroviral drugs, which target the activity of HERVs, have shown promising results in MND patients suggesting a potential link between HERV dysregulation and disease progression. However, the precise mechanisms by which HERVs contribute to MND pathogenesis and the therapeutic efficacy of targeting HERVs on protein aggregation in MND require further investigation. This is where the NERVLAB comes in!
