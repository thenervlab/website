We are thrilled to introduce the NERVLAB team spearheading groundbreaking research projects in 2025. We welcome back familiar faces Jay and Aquilina, plus meet Steph and Nikkita - a group of superstars bringing their unique expertise and passion to the challenge of understanding neurodegenerative disease.

After completing a short research placement in 2024, both  Jay and Aquilina are back on board with fresh HERV focused projects. Jay is working on deciphering the role of endogenous retroviruses in TDP-43 aggregation associated with motor neuron disease. His work will build brand new expression models for HERV RNA and protein products that will let us probe their effect independently - a very important tool that will unlock new research avenues. Aquilina, NERVLAB's newest PhD candidate, will continue her efforts to interrogate the cellular footprint of human endogenous retroviruses in motor neuron disease. Her work will apply advanced proximity labelling techniques to map the interactome of HERV polyproteins, the first steps toward understanding how HERVs impact fundamental cellular processes.

Nikkita, completing her Honours degree, is set to explore the proteomic drivers behind climate resilience in Fijian *Hylaeus* bees. Now I know what you're thinking - ***bees***? But yes, bees! With support from a UOW interdisciplinary grant, her project is our first foray into whole organism biology and is an exciting new collaboration with Dr James Dorey aka the Bee guy üêù Nikkita jets off to Fiji in April, and has lots of exciting differential expression and thermal proteome profiling proteomics to look forward to later in the year.

Last but certainly not least, Steph has joined the team as our latest and greatest research assistant. As well as keeping the lab running smoothly, Steph is working to develop a modular RNA-targeting system by integrating two cutting-edge methodologies. Her work will create a cell model with customisable, interchangeable targeting and effector modules, paving the way for new experimental approaches.

Join us in welcoming these future research leaders to the NERVLAB team - and stay tuned for updates on their groundbreaking research endeavors!
