We are thrilled to introduce the newest members of the NERVLAB team who are spearheading groundbreaking research projects in 2024. Meet Dylan, Jay and Annaliese, each bringing their unique expertise and passion as we work to unravel the complexities of neurodegenerative disease.

[Jay](http://localhost:1313/research/team/#:~:text=Jay%20Hill), an undergraduate research student, is focused on developing an in-house method to produce custom silicon gaskets compatible with single-molecule and super-resolution microscopy. This project will enable us to profile extremely small volumes of samples in high-throughput, significantly improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of our novel assay platforms.

[Dylan](http://localhost:1313/research/team/#:~:text=Dylan%20Norris), our honours student, is leading the development of a novel single-molecule assay for characterizing protein aggregates of SOD1 derived from experimental model systems such as cells and mice. This assay will eventually allow us to profile aggregates from human samples, including from individuals living with motor neuron disease, to better understand their disease presentation, progression, and potentially prognosis.

[Annaliese](http://localhost:1313/research/team/#:~:text=Annaliese%20Cox), our research intern, is dedicated to developing a novel cell model system which decouples protein expression from the presence of its corresponding mRNA in mammalian cells. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of ERV gene expression and its implications for disease pathology.

Together, Jay, Dylan, and Annaliese represent the future of neurodegenerative disease research at NERVLAB. Their dedication, creativity, and commitment to scientific excellence inspire us all as we work towards our shared mission. Join us in welcoming them to the team and stay tuned for updates on their groundbreaking research endeavors!
