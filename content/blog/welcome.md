Welcome to the NERVLAB! We're thrilled to launch our new research team based at the University of Wollongong, Australia. We are working to unravel the mysteries of neurodegenerative disease, particularly Motor Neuron Disease (MND). Our mission is clear: to develop innovative solutions for diagnosis and treatment by advancing understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying these devastating disorders.

Our philosophy is rooted in collaboration, innovation, and a dedicated pursuit of scientific excellence. We bring together a diverse team of researchers, clinicians, and data scientists, each bringing their unique expertise together to tackle the most pressing questions in the field of neurodegenerative disease and beyond.

Through our blog, we aim to provide insights into our research, share exciting discoveries, and engage with the broader community. Join us on this journey as we delve into the fascinating world of endogenous retroviruses and work towards a future where neurodegenerative diseases are no longer a threat. Curious to learn more in the meantime? Check out our [Research Themes](https://www.thenervlab.org/research/themes), [Team](https://www.thenervlab.org/research/team), and [Publications](https://www.thenervlab.org/research/publications). Stay tuned for more updates from the NERVLAB!
