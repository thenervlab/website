At NERVLAB, our research philosophy is grounded in the belief that diversity drives innovation. We recognize the transformative power of bringing together minds from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives to tackle the most challenging questions in science. 

From single particles to whole proteomes, our toolbox spans orders of magnitude, reflecting our commitment to exploring the breadth and depth of scientific inquiry. We believe in fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment where every voice is valued, every idea is heard, and every contribution is celebrated.

Central to our philosophy is a shared commitment to excellence, integrity, and professionalism. We embrace the quirks and complexities of scientific exploration, recognising that true innovation often arises from surprising and unexpected places. Our approach champions open communication, mutual respect, and a willingness to embrace new ideas and methodologies. By cultivating a culture of curiosity, collaboration, and inclusivity, we aim to push the boundaries of scientific knowledge and make meaningful contributions to understanding endogenous retroviruses as they contribute to neurodegenerative disease and beyond.
