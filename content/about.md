Our mission is to understand how endogenous retroviruses contribute to human neurobiology, in both health and disease. 

To achieve this, we are developing a novel molecular toolbox spanning orders of magnitude; from single particles to whole proteomes. It combines affinity-directed proximity labelling mass spectrometry and single molecule super-resolution microscopy, allowing us to comprehensively characterise the cellular fingerprint of human endogenous retroviruses. 

We believe the best science happens when everyone feels welcome, valued and supported to dream ⭐big⭐. Find out more about how you can contribute to our mission below.
