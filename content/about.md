Our mission is to unravel the fundamental biology of neurodegenerative disease. We seek to understand the complex interplay between protein aggregation and endogenous retroviruses, especially how they contribute to human neurobiology in both health and disease. 

To achieve this, we are developing a novel molecular toolbox spanning orders of magnitude; from single particles to whole proteomes. It combines affinity-directed proximity labelling mass spectrometry and single molecule super-resolution microscopy, allowing us to comprehensively characterise the cellular fingerprint of human endogenous retroviruses. 

We believe the best science happens when everyone feels welcome, valued and supported to dream {{< icon "star" >}} big {{< icon "star" >}} .
